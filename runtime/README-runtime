This directory contains the files defining the link-time and run-time
environment for your generated assembly files.  The autograder uses
(almost) identical runtime files to grade your code upon hand-in.

The driver can link the runtime with your generated
<file>.s, using the command

% gcc -m64 <file>.s ../runtime/run411.c

to generate the executable a.out, which it will then run and
test for the correct answer.
